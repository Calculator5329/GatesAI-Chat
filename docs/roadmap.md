# Roadmap

## Done
- [x] Clean up dead code, root HTML mockups, and unused assets
- [x] Convert codebase to TypeScript
- [x] Introduce MobX object model (ChatStore / UiStore / RootStore)
- [x] Split monolithic `chat-variant.jsx` and `gates-menu.jsx` into
      small, focused components
- [x] Document architecture, changelog, roadmap
- [x] **Phase 1**: extract `components/ui/` design-system primitives
- [x] **Phase 2**: `LlmProvider` interface + multi-provider router
      (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, Local OpenAI-compatible)
- [x] **Phase 3**: tiny hash router (`#/thread/<id>`, `#/menu/<section>`)
- [x] **Phase 4**: Vitest suite under top-level `tests/` + lint + typecheck CI
- [x] **Phase 5**: Live OpenRouter catalog (`ModelRegistry` + `OpenRouterStore`,
      registry-backed model picker with pricing, API panel refresh button)
- [x] Add minimalist Ctrl/Cmd-click copy gesture to chat messages
- [x] Local-only `git` tool for status, diff, add, commit, and branch work
- [x] Add hybrid markdown/code Appearance tweaker with persisted presets
- [x] Add `inspect_file` tool for compact CSV, JSON, and text inspection
- [x] Smooth active assistant streaming with batched text updates and incremental markdown rendering
- [x] Add Windows double-click launcher for chat + bridge
- [x] Inject artifact README files into every turn's system prompt context
- [x] Inject runtime time, timezone, and harness context into every turn
- [x] Make `inspect_file` encoding-tolerant and add artifact-first query workflows
- [x] Start architecture boundary cleanup: move icons out of `core/`, replace
      service-to-store type imports with facades, and add staged import rules
- [x] Extract shared tool-call rendering to `components/ui/`
- [x] File attachments in the composer via the bridge workspace
- [x] Move attachment upload behind a `BridgeStore` facade and promote UI
      service-import boundaries to lint errors
- [x] Extract ChatStore runtime context, artifact README loading, and tool
      failure logging helpers into focused services
- [x] Multimodal cleanup (structured tool artifacts, facade-only bridge
      service, shared `SecretKeyField`, unified image-backend types,
      `Api.tsx` split, composer upload action on `UiStore`, Routing card
      marked as Coming soon)
- [x] Local image-gen quality pass: SDXL Lightning hi-res workflow, sweep3
      model comparison script, picker manifest auto-detect, and LLM prompt
      enhancement controls
- [x] Local image-gen tuning pass: narrow FLUX.2/Z-Image winner sweep and
      Ultimate SD Upscale 2x benchmark mode
- [x] Prepare local image-gen finalization: SDXL quick draft lane, reusable
      final ComfyUI workflow templates, and winner selection script
- [x] Add FLUX.2 Klein FP8 wide recovery benchmark for final workflow selection
- [x] Ollama provider — local LLMs in the model picker via the Ollama runtime
      (native NDJSON `/api/chat`, catalog refresh, status pill, per-model
      `supportsTools` allowlist, global tool-calls toggle)
- [x] Add local image-generation size controls: named aspect ratios plus
      explicit pixel dimensions for ComfyUI/A1111
- [x] Add a dedicated Local menu for Ollama, ComfyUI, and local vision setup
      (auto-detect install paths, managed Start/Stop, live logs, ComfyUI CORS
      flags, local vision `describe_image` tool)

## Near-term
- [ ] **Multimodal + image-gen, phased** — see `docs/plans/2026-04-26-multimodal-and-imagegen.md`
      - [x] Phase 1: Vision input (cloud + local), content-parts at the wire boundary
      - [x] Phase 2: FLUX 2.0 image generation via fal.ai, saved as workspace artifact
      - [x] Phase 3: Local image-gen backend (ComfyUI / A1111) behind same `image_generate` tool
- [ ] Continue architecture cleanup: split large tools/components and keep
      slimming `ChatStore` where helpers can move out safely
- [ ] Persist theme keys alongside existing output style preferences
- [ ] Wire the API / Settings / Agent menu sections to real state
- [ ] Add basic unit tests around `ChatStore` (send, stream, switch, stop)

## Later
- [ ] Move appearance controls out of the floating Tweaks panel and into
      the Appearance menu section
- [ ] Multi-window / split-thread layouts
- [ ] Extend `inspect_file` to source-code structure (`py`, `js`, `ts`, `go`)
- [ ] Extend `inspect_file` to document formats (`pdf`, `docx`, `xlsx`)
